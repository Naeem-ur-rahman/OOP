Create a class called ship that incorporates a ship’s number and location. Use the approach of Exercise 8 to number each ship object as it is created. Use two variables of the angle class from Exercise 7 to represent the ship’s latitude and longitude. A member function of the ship class should get a position from the user and store it in the object; another should report the serial number and position. Write a main() program that creates three ships, asks the user to input the position of each, and then displays each ship’s number and position.
You can use the hex character constant ‘\xF8’, which usually prints a degree (°) symbol.
